Intro

Text to Speech / Speech synthesis is used for conversational interactions. Ex - Talks between two people. 

TTS is audio output component which can be used for feedback, confirmation of requests and final output of results.

Current open-weight models suitable for Indian languages are
    - indicF5
    - indic-parler-tts

Both models are released from AI4Bharat research organisation.

We use indicF5 because it is faster and used with single prompts for voice generation

Code is provided in the repository to try out both models which can be utilized based on requirements.
